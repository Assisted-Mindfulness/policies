# Assisted Mindfulness Policies, Terms, and Legal Stuff

The rough print and the fine print. We try to make all our policies as clear, fair, and readable as possible.

## A Note About the Links

If you try to click on any of the Support links in this repository, you'll get a 404 page. Don't despair! You can always reach us at hello@emot.io.
Your emails all go to our same friendly team.

So how come the links don't work in this repository? The short answer is: we made a technical tradeoff. The long answer is, we copy the policies in this repository to our product marketing sites. To make it easier to transfer, we are now using relative links, convert Markdown links to a valid web URL, and some variables.



## Public Contributions Welcome

We welcome our customers—you!—to suggest changes to our policies and to offer feedback on the changes we have planned. Please do chime in on any open pull request, or even file a pull request yourself.
